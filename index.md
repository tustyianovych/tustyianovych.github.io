## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Artificial Intelligence Systems](https://lpnu.ua/en/ais) at Lviv Polytechnic National University. My research interests include Data Science for Climate Change, Multimodal Data Processing, and Social Communications Analysis. I am always open to collaboration and cooperation in these areas. 

My Ph.D. thesis focuses on **multimodal data fusion** for **climate change modeling** and **social awareness improvement**. I use artificial intelligence and data science to forecast physical climate indicators for specific regions and find the most optimal set of parameters to minimize the consequences of environmental issues. Another crucial area of my research is the study of tipping points that lead to significant shifts in social perception of climate problems. Further, I worked on a research project funded by the [Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/canadian-institute-of-ukrainian-studies/index.html) on multi-task classification of data from instant messaging platforms in cooperation with the University of Alberta (Canada).

In addition to academia, I possess more than 5 years of industry experience across various domains (e-commerce, EdTech, FinTech) at [EPAM Systems](https://www.epam.com/) where I act as a Lead Software Engineer with strong expertise in data science, machine learning operations, and observability.
